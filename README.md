As you level up you will be able to complete the level faster and faster. Keep playing until you can acheieve a gold medal on each level!

# Requirements
python, pygame

# Startup
Simply run "main.py" to start the game. There is a pre-loaded save file in the form of a pickle file. You can choose to "load" game to get a character somewhat leveled up already if you want to just jump into the game. Otherwise, starting from scratch means alot of dying as you scrap for coins!
